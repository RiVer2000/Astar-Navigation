# A* Navigation

## Aim
To implement A* grid search algorithm on python and learn some basics of pygame library.

## Description
A* algorithm is one of the more popular algorithms used for grid search which provides optimal path while also cutting down on computaional time. The distances used are generally Euclidean and Manhattan distances. In my code I have used Euclidean Distance as I aimed  for my .
